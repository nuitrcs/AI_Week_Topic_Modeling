# Topic Modeling Exercises

We have prepared two exercises.  We will work on the first before lunch and the second after lunch.  For both exercises you will work together in groups and give a short presentation of your results at the end.

## Exercise 1: Investigating parameters

Please join one of the following four groups.  Each group will explore how changing parameters in one step affects the topic modeling pipeline:

- Group 1: Embeddings
- Group 2: Dimension Reduction
- Group 3: Clustering
- Group 4: Labelling

We will work for 60 minutes, and then each group will give a 10-minute presentation on their findings.  

If you prefer to work on Colab, you can find the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nuitrcs/AI_Week_Topic_Model/blob/main/exercises/exercise1.ipynb).  If you are working on your local computer, you can use `exercise1.ipynb` within this directory (and remember to run this inside your conda environment). 

Each group will focus on the parameters in their own section (e.g., Group 1 will focus on changing parameters for the Embedding step), but will also run the entire topic modeling pipeline from start to finish, leaving parameters for the other steps on their default values.  Each time you change a parameter in your section, please run the entire pipeline to see the resulting topics that are identified and labeled.  Save the results of each run (e.g. save the result dataframe to your computer as a csv, or take a screen grab) so that you can remember the differences and share those with us in your presentation.

## Exercise 2: Investigating different datasets

Please join one of the following five groups.  Each group will explore a different dataset and create a topic modeling workflow to share :

- Group 1: Laws
- Group 2: Hotel reviews
- Group 3: Product classification 
- Group 4: 20 Newsgroups
- Group 5: Choose your own datset


We will work for 2 hours, and then each group will give a 10-minute presentation on their process and findings.
