BERTopic explains how you can make better representations [here](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/best_practices/best_practices.html#improving-default-representation) and [here](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/representation/representation.html). Try different approaches for yourself! You are not limited to what's provided in the BERTopic package, however. As we saw in the demo, you can utilize models outside of BERTopic to try to extract topics and keywords."
